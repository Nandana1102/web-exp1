    <h3>PHOTOSYNTHESIS</h3>
    <P>Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce their own food in the form of glucose. This process takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells, which contain a green pigment called chlorophyll. During photosynthesis, oxygen is also released as a byproduct, which is essential for most living organisms. It is the foundation of life on Earth, as it provides energy and oxygen for animals and humans.</P>

    <h4>NEWTONS LAW</h4>
    <P>Newton's Laws of Motion are three fundamental principles that describe how objects move. The first law, also called the law of inertia, states that an object will remain at rest or in motion unless acted upon by an external force. The second law explains how force, mass, and acceleration are related: Force = Mass × Acceleration (F = ma). The third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. These laws form the foundation of classical mechanics and help us understand how everything moves — from falling apples to rockets launching into space.</P>
